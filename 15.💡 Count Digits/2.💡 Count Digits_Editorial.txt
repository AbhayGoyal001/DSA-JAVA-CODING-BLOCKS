Logic is pretty simple viz, to extract digit from the number one by one, till the number become zero and take a counter that will increment by one each time you extract a digit.

To extract digit from a number, you need to know a mathematical operation viz, modulus ( % ) that's for finding the remainder of any number when divided by a number.
If we perform modulus ( % ) of any number by 10, we get the last digit.
If the extracted digit is similar to the item provided then increment your counter by 1.
If we Divide ( / ) any number by 10, the last digit get removed form the number.
So, that next digit will be extracted from the last.
Code

 public static int countDigits(int n, int item){

        int cnt = 0;
        while(n != 0){

            int rem = n % 10;

            if(rem == item) cnt++;
            n = n/10;

        }

        return cnt;
    }
