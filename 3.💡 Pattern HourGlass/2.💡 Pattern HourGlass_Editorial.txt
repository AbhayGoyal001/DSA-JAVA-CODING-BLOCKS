In Pattern Question, there is a common method which we teach in course viz, taking nsp, nst, csp, cst and row variables.

Pattern Hack: Always first Try to first print pattern by ignoring the value to be printed then accommodate your value in that pattern. For e.g.,

                      5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5
                        4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 
                          3 2 1 0 1 2 3 
                            2 1 0 1 2 
                              1 0 1 
                                0 
                              1 0 1 
                            2 1 0 1 2 
                          3 2 1 0 1 2 3 
                        4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 
                      5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5
View it as:-

                      * * * * * * * * * * *
                        * * * * * * * * * 
                          * * * * * * * 
                            * * * * * 
                              * * * 
                                * 
                              * * * 
                            * * * * * 
                          * * * * * * * 
                        * * * * * * * * * 
                      * * * * * * * * * * *
Short Info about the variables:-


1. nsp (number of spaces)-> Number of spaces in very First Line of the pattern.
2. nst (number of stars)-> Number of stars in very first line of the pattern.
3. csp (counter of spaces)-> counter of spaces that will print the required number of spaces and will be initialized with 1 and incremented upto nsp.
4. cst (counter of stars)->  counter of spaces that will print the required number of stars and will be initialized with 1 and incremented upto nst.
5. rows -> It will be initialized with 1 and will go upto the total number of rows in the pattern.
Given pattern is seen as first spaces and then numbers.The numbers are first in in decreasing order and then in increasing order in a row. Spaces first increases and then decreases in a row. So do the work of spaces first and then that of numbers.And then change variables accordingly for next iterations.

Code:


import java.util.Scanner;
public class patternhb {


    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in) ;

        int n = scn.nextInt();

        int rows = 2 * n + 1;     //number of rows

        int nst = 2 * n + 1;      //initializing number of numbers
        int nsp = 0;             //initializing number of spaces   
        for (int row = 1; row <= rows; row++) {
            int val;
            if (row <= n + 1) // for  first n + 1 numbers val is n - row + 1
                val = n - row + 1;
            else
                val = row - n - 1; // for rest numbers val is row - n - 1

         //work for spaces
            for (int csp = 1; csp <= nsp; csp++) {
                System.out.print("  ");
            }

        //work for numbers
        //Till n numbers are in decreasing order and then in increasing order
            for (int cst = 1; cst <= nst; cst++) {
                System.out.print(val + " ");
                if (cst <= nst / 2)
                    val--;
                else
                    val++;
            }
         // preparation for next iteration
            if (row <= n) {
                nsp++;
                nst -= 2;
            } else {
                nsp--;
                nst += 2;
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }

}
