Any number which has only two divisors, one divisor is the number itself and other divisor is 1, is called as Prime number.


Algorithmn

Take input of the number.
put a loop from 2 to that number.
If the number gets divided by any number in the loop, that means the number is not Prime.
Othewise, Prime.
Code


public static boolean isPrime(int n) {

        if (n <= 1)
            return false;

        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++)
            if (n % i == 0)
                return false;

        return true;
}
