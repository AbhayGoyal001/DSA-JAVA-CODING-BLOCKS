The Question in Simple language is that:

You have given a number and in that number, the digits which are even should have sum divisible by 4 or the sum of digits which are odd should be divisible by the 3, Only then you can say yes otherwise you will say no.

Algorithm

Take input of the Number.
Declare two variables to store the sum of even numbers and odd numbers.
Extract digit one by one ( by % 10).
  1.Check if the number is even or odd.
  2.If even add the number in the variable storing even sum.

  1.Othewise add it in the variable storing odd sum.

After the loop, Check if the even sum is divisible by 4.
  1.If True, print Yes.
  2.otherwise print No.
Check if the odd sum is divisible by 3.
  1.If True, print Yes.
  2.otherwise print No.

Lang - Java

public static void oddEven(int n){

        int oddSum = 0;
        int evenSum = 0;

        while(n != 0){

            int rem = n % 10;
            if(rem % 2 == 0){
                evenSum += rem;
            }else{
                oddSum += rem;
            }

            n = n/ 10;
        }

        if(evenSum % 4 == 0 || oddSum % 3 == 0){
            System.out.println("Yes");
        }else{
            System.out.println("No");
        }
    }
